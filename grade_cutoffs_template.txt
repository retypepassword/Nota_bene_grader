## Grading Settings

## Don't count comments as substantial_comments if they have fewer than:
## (they'll be considered "short_comments" instead)
min_words_per_comment: 5
min_hashtag_length: 2
avg_letters_per_word: 4

## Recommend leaving this as true, unless you want to allow comments like
## "something something something something something"
words_cannot_be_same_length: true

## Please write scores in descending order. The script won't work right if
## they're not in descending order. More than 5 scores can be added if
## necessary.
Scores:
    # For a score of 5, the student must have made at least 4 substantial
    # comments or at least 10 comments total, with a total of at least 35 words
    # between the comments
